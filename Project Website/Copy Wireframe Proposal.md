# Kurate Project Website: Copy Wireframe Proposal

1.HEADER: Carousel where the "What if we all can be" stays fixed, but the image and corresponding name changes. The first image, a representation of Satoshi. When the images change, so does certain text in the section below (bolded for reference).
## What if we all can be Satoshi Nakamoto

2.SUB-HEADER AREA:

### Imagine being able to post through Satoshi's online Persona. What would you say? 

In Kurate, you and your peers remain anonymous but post publicly as a Persona. It's like everyone is wearing a **Satoshi** Mask.

### But it's not just a free-for-all. 
Your peers vote on whether or not your post is characteristic of what **Satoshi** would say. If they think it is, your post goes public and you earn positive reputation. 

### You vote on your peers' posts too. 
That way as a community, you are curating the **Satoshi** Persona together. Unfolding **his** character one post at a time, through text and images. And when you vote in-line with the community, you earn positive reputation.

**CTA**: [Play as Satoshi]

### More on Voting, Staking, REP, and GO
Community members have 4 hours to judge whether or not a new post is appropriate for the Persona, by voting to promote or demote it. Depending on how strongly they feel, they may use one or many votes — up to the limit of 30 daily votes. 

Voting in the direction of the community earns the voter 1 REP — the reputation token used throughout all Kurate Personas. For spam prevention, each vote costs 1 "GO" token. 

**Post Staking**
A user stakes 5 of their REP to submit a post, plus 1 GO. If the community votes to promote it, the post ends up in the public timeline, and the poster receives their staked REP back, plus 5 more.

**GO Token**
GO is the token used to animate Kurate. You spend GO to submit posts and vote. 30 GO is automatically issued to everyone daily, but they do not roll over to the next day. You will only ever have a max of 30 GO tokens.

### Why are we experimenting with anonymous posting through a Persona?
Personal privacy is an essential component of human liberty. But in order for people to feel comfortable interacting with each other, it is important certain reputational things are known. We need individual privacy coupled with public reputation. Why is privacy important?

**Most identifying information is unnecessary.**
Reputation in context is often sufficient — in many public settings one's identity is not relevant, only their reputation. For example if you hire a developer, it's not useful to know their address or even their name. As long as you're confident about their reputation as a skilled coder, it's reasonable to think they'll do a good job for you. 

**It's risky to give up more personal info than is needed.**
Because of social, economic, and security repercussions, someone with their whole identity on the line is more likely to self-censor. Posting anonymously gives community members the freedom to be themselves, without fear of ridicule, cancellation, or identity theft.

**Group affiliation and curation.**
With Kurate, we propose that one solution is public reputation through group affiliation. When you "play" through a Persona, you earn reputation through positive public actions — posting and voting. So anyone interaction with you privately knows a bit about what type of community member you are.

Plus, anon community members in a Persona curate each post, deciding whether or not the post is contextually appropriate. In this way groups have a say over how their community's Persona is publicly perceived.

**This gives users the ability to post anonymously, and allows the community some oversight, curating posts to make sure they are in character.**

## Anon Marketplaces
Unstoppable commerce has long been a dream of OG web3-ers, but it's not practical to implement without privacy-enabled interactions. For commerce to be unstoppable, there needs to be no attack vectors for those who wish to censor it. Identity is an attack vector, and privacy is the remedy.

But people must have a way to identify the good actors from the bad, which means an anonymous version of reputation is needed. Several orgs are already creating this technology; Unirep and the Ethereum Foundation for example. There are multiple methods; the method employed in Kurate is reputation through group affiliation.

Some combination of reputation through group affiliation, and through non-repudiable attestation likely gives us privacy-enabled marketplaces.
