## The Outlet is a Marketplace where peaceful people go to trade, so they may buy and sell the goods and services that sustain themselves, their families, and each other.

**Peaceful humans traffic in life-sustaining activities.** They trade the fruits of their creativity and labor for the fruits of the creativity and labor of their peers. And as long as the marketplace is just and true, everyone wins and life perpetuates peacefully. 

**The Outlet is a just and true marketplace. What does that look like?**  

### The Outlet:

- Is a decentralized web app where people trade goods and services using digital currency, and in the process earn context-specific reputation. It's where people find each other, communicate, and transact.
- Is voluntary, opt-in and out. Any peaceful person who wants to be there can be, and may leave when they want.
- Resists censorship. Peaceful people who wish to voluntarily trade goods and services may do so, frictionless, as long as they do not hurt anyone or take their stuff.
- Is owned by the **Users** who frequent it. Because of this, communities who inhabit the marketplace are incentivized to succeed and flourish together.
- Respects privacy and discretion, acknowledging that goods and services are "the product", not user data.
- Is impacted by the reputation of its **Users**, and in turn impacts the reputation of its **Users**.
- Has **Stewards** who help resolve disputes when they come up. **Stewards** are incentivized to act in the best interest of the marketplace and its community.
- Has a friendly UX that helps **Users** clearly articulate in words or images what they hope to achieve, whether it's "to buy", "to sell", or "to resolve disputes". 
- Promotes compassion, honesty, and respect by being all of the above.

### Trade is Cooperation:
All humans have unique skill sets, and no human is good at everything. So humans must work together, pool our expertise if you will, to achieve the best possible outcomes. We are each others' effort multipliers. That's why humans are social, so we inspire each other into cooperation. 

When humans distribute goods and services through trade, they are acting socially, peacefully, but they need a venue in which to do it. That venue is a Marketplace, in this case The Outlet. 

For peace and prosperity.
