## The light in me recognizes and honors the light in you.
**Raydee is the home city of peaceful people known as the Raydians**. With the help of a prism-like device called a "**Kee**" they hold in their hand, their internal light can be focused, refracted, and projected as an Avatar representing their identity. 

Each Raydian is unique, therefore the color, brilliance, shape, and size of their unfocused internal energy is also unique. Without the Kee, they have an "all or nothing" choice for emanating it. To reveal all is to be completely exposed.

Some Raydians are more ambitious, some more reserved and their light reveals that. Some are older, and perhaps wiser and more amber. Some are younger, with white-hot brilliance. Some are philosophers and carpenters. There are blue flames, green, and orange glows, depending on the makeup of their inner light. The full spectrum is possible.

### Their light is their identity, their fingerprint. 
It represents all their characteristics — creativity, knowledge, skillset, everything they've earned, experienced, and learned expressed as their individual emanation. But it also shows their "state". You can see when they're all filled up, supercharged. You can see when their energy is low, in need of nourishment. Their age and fitness. How they feel at the moment. If they were to emit their light unfiltered, they would show all of themselves.

Since their light shows everything about these Raydee City dwellers, it's the most precious thing in the world to them. You might imagine they are protective of exposing their light, and you would be right! Raydians are inherently peaceful people, but like all societies there is a small percentage of anti-social beings among them looking to take advantage, hurt, or steal. So it's important Raydians can guard themselves and their light against folly. 

**But also, sometimes it's just more comfortable to keep certain personal things to oneself, for all parties involved.**

### Raydians choose what they emit.
Luckily, using a Kee, Raydians have the ability to choose which frequencies of their light get emitted, and how much. They can focus it, bending light to create the Avatar that best fits the situation they're in.

And they may emit all, nothing, or anything in between. But! They cannot emit what's not there, only what they've created, earned, or learned. The Kee focuses their light to what's needed at the time, but stays true to what exists internally.

**It takes a certain amount of wisdom to discern when and what to show, so Raydians wait until they are mature enough to earn their Kee.**

If they want to move through the world completely protected they would keep their Kee secure, and only their pilot light — their spark of life would show. But in many cases (for example instances where they might need to show reputation) they would find it fitting to emit their Avatar, in hue and brilliance, in shape and size, that represents the attributes they wish others to see — what is appropriate for the context of the moment.

### Raydians share reputation through Clubs.

Raydians often band together into **Clubs**, pooling their reputation. By doing so, the reputation of a Club is only as strong as its least trusted member. That means anyone who interacts with a member knows they at least meet a minimum threshold of reputation.

**Membership has its privileges!**

How does one know they are dealing with a member of a Club? Each Club has its own **Emblem** — like squad colors — and all Club members are able to emit it using their Kee. A Club's Emblem is the personification of of the Club's reputation. By using a Club's Emblem, a Raydian may enjoy individual anonymity and group reputation as they interact with their peers.

### Trade in Raydee.
Like all peaceful people, Raydians trade with each other for goods and services. Their preferred marketplace is **The Outlet**, where they go to find all sorts of supplies, or just to simply recharge. They happily give a little bit of their internal light energy as payment for the things they need. 

**The transaction is quite something to see.** 

When it's time to pay, both Raydians hold up their Kees facing each other, and energy is transferred from one to the other, focused through their Kee, absorbed into the receiver's inner pilot light.

Although an open market, **The Outlet** isn't some free-for-all. No-no-no! There are reputational requirements for entry, so Raydians must emit enough of themselves to satisfy that requirement. But beyond that minimum they only reveal what they choose.

## Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Create privacy-enabled identities and chat

Rena has come of age and earned her Kee. Kees allow residents of Raydee City the ability to show certain, appropriate-for-the-situation aspects of their identity and reputation in the form of an Avatar. It helps them prove trustworthy in commerce settings, friendly in social settings. 

Rena is excited to take her Kee for a spin, knowing she can now access parts of the city that were once closed off to her when she could not prove her reputation. She's most interested in social places where she can connect with other Raydians with similar values.

But first things first! Rena must learn how to program her Kee to only emit the aspects of her identity needed for the siutation she's in — her context-appropriate Avatar. For example when renting an Otto, it's important for Rena to be able to prove she has passed safety tests, and that she has insurance. But it's not necessary to show her exact date of birth. So she must program her Kee to emit some things, and filter out the rest.

Let's help Rena integrate and use this valuable technology so she can explore new parts of her city. Let's help her find people and interact.
