## Overview
The most relevant interactions in Kurate revolve around posting content. A post is a content container created by an anonymous Player, which may include text, images, and video. The post is created within a Persona and submitted to the Persona's community for curation (voting). 

If the community votes to "Promote" the post, it graduates to the Persona's main page. If the community votes to "Demote", the post is deleted.

The goal of the posting Player is to create content that the community feels is "in character" of the Persona, and therefore is Promoted. Promoted content is the "voice" of the Persona. So, to create Promoted content is to Speak through the Persona. 

Another way to look at it is: A Player posts public content while wearing the Persona like a mask, so their identity remains private.

## Reputation through posting
A Player gains reputation (REP)by posting content the community votes to Promote. The more REP a Player earns, the more they are able to participate in Kurate. 

For example, different Personas require different minimum total REP amounts to post. The minimum REP requirement is chosen by a Player when they create the Persona, and can range between 5â€”150 REP. The more REP a Player has, the more Personas they may post in.

### Staking REP
In order to submit a post for curation, a Player must stake 5 REP. If the community votes to Promote their post, the 5 staked REP is returned to the Player. The Player also receives a 5 REP reward. If the community votes to Demote, the Player's 5 staked REP is confiscated. 

**The more in-character one posts, the more REP one earns.**

Keep in mind, the staking requirement is always 5 REP no matter what the minimum total REP requirement is. For example, if a Persona requires 25 REP to participate, a Player must have at least 25 REP total, with 5 REP currently not staked in order to submit a post.

### Reputation through curation
Players vote on whether or not a post is relevant to, and characteristic of the Persona it was submitted in. Because of this group curation mechanism, it is possible for anonymous Players to remain accountable to their community.

Voters receive 1 REP if they vote in the direction of the community. For example, if the community votes to Promote a post, every Player who voted to Promote earns 1 REP. The same is true if the community votes to Demote a post. Every Player who voted to Demote, earns 1 REP. 

There is no staking requirement for voting, and no lost REP for voting in the opposite direction of the community.

## How to post

**On the main page of a Persona, select "Submit post" to create anonymous content.**

This is the "Submit post" info page, which informs you that submitting a post for community review costs 5 GO and requires the poster to stake 5 REP. 

**By choosing "Proceed", you'll advance to the screen where you can craft your post.**

A post is under review until the end of an Cycle. In Kurate, an Cycle lasts 8 hours, but posts submitted mid Cycle for example, will only remain under review for the rest of the Cycle. In that case 4 hours. If the community chooses to "Promote" your post it will graduate to the Persona's main page, and your 5 staked REP will be returned. You will also earn 5 REP.

If the community chooses to "Demote" your post it will evaporate, and you will lose your 5 staked REP.
