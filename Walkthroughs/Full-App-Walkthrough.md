# Full App Walkthrough
###### tags: `Kurate` `expression` `FAQ`

Gameplay in Kurate is easy and fun! You have two main objectives. The first is to anonymously post content through a group identity called a "Persona". A Persona is the public face of any content you post in Kurate. Players post content that's "in the character of" a Persona.

The second is to help curate Persona content by voting on whether or not you believe posts from your peers are "in the character of" that Persona. You earn reputation through both objectives.

Navigate to kurate.eth. As a logged-out viewer you will be able to peruse the app, but if you wish to participate by voting, posting, or creating a Persona, you will need to connect your web3 wallet.

**To link your wallet, tap "Connect" in the top right corner.**

The first screen you encounter is the Persona page. This is the list of active Personas you may post content as. Each Persona has its own theme, and a community of people posting and curating content around that theme. 

**Select a Persona that seems interesting to you.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/VtUfYn8.png)

On the main Persona page you'll see a description of the Persona, as well as all the posts that the community has voted to Promote. By reading the description and posts, you can get a feel for what the community believes the Persona is all about.

From this page you have two main options. You may review pending posts (posts the community is currently voting on), or submit a post for community review, with the hopes they will vote to Promote it to the Persona's main page. 

## Review pending: curation through voting

![](https://i.imgur.com/sRJWsBF.png)

On this page you see all the posts submitted for community review. If you believe a post is in character of the Persona, you may vote to Promote it. If not, you may vote to Demote it. If the majority believes the post is in character, the post will be graduated to the main Persona page. If not, the post will be relegated to oblivion. 

**A post is under review until the end of a Cycle.** 
In Kurate, a Cycle lasts 8 hours, but posts submitted mid Cycle for example, will only remain under review for the rest of the Cycle. In that case 4 hours. 

**Choosing to Promote or Demote takes you to the Vote Info page. But first, let's talk about GO tokens.**

### GO Tokens
It's important to note that for spam prevention, and to inspire participation, all gameplay actions in Kurate require payment in "GO" tokens. 

**GO is granted not earned.** 
Every Cycle (8 hours) all players are given 30 GO. GO does not role over. Unused GO expires at the beginning of the next Cycle, while simultaneously players are replenished with 30 new GO.

**GO cost of gameplay actions:**
- Voting: 1 GO per vote
- Submit a post for review: 5 GO
- Create a Persona: 10 GO

### Voting

This is the Vote Info page. As you can see, voting costs 1 GO token. If you have enough tokens available, you may proceed and your vote will be counted.

**You promoted this.**

At the end of the Cycle, if the majority of voters Promoted the post, it will graduate to the Persona's main page. If Demoted, the post will disappear. For a post to get Promoted, it must have a minimum of 3 total votes, and a simple majority of "Promote" votes.

Posts that do not achieve the minimum vote threshold, or have a tie vote are deleted.

**If you vote in the same direction as the majority, you will earn reputation (REP).**

### Reputation
Players earn reputation (REP) for positive actions, as determined by the community. REP scores determine which Personas a Player may post as. A minimum REP threshold is determined by a Persona creator.

**Earning REP**
- Voting in the direction of the community earns you 1 REP.
- If you submit a post and the community votes to Promote it to the main Persona page, you earn 5 REP.

**Staking REP**
Submitting a post for community review costs 5 REP, that way a poster has skin in the game. If the community decides to Promote their post, the Player receives their staked REP back, plus a 5 REP reward. If the community votes to Demote, the Player loses their staked REP. 

In the case of a tie vote, or if the post fails to receive the minimum threshold of votes (3), the post will be deleted and the 5 staked REP will return to the poster. The poster will not receive bonus REP.

**REP minimums**
Personas may have different minimum REP requirements for posting. For example, a Persona that has a 100 REP minimum requires the Player to have at least 100 total REP to submit a post. However, this minimum does not change the 5 REP staking requirement. So in this example a Player must have at least 100 total REP, and 5 available (not staked) REP.


## Submit post: creating anonymous content
A Persona gives a Player the ability to remain anonymous while posting publicly. It's like wearing a Persona mask. But because posts are curated, the community gets to determine whether or not a post is appropriate for that Persona. In this way Kurate provides anonymity with accountability.

![](https://i.imgur.com/RGrU3D6.png)

**On the main page of a Persona, select "Submit post" to create anonymous content.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/dcjORBr.png)

This is the "Submit post" info page, which informs you that submitting a post for community review costs 5 GO and requires the poster to stake 5 REP. 

**By choosing "Proceed", you'll advance to the screen where you can craft your post.**

**Write post copy here.**

**Add an image by selecting the picture icon in the top right corner. Then choose "Submit" to send your post to community review.**

A post is under review until the end of an Cycle. In Kurate, an Cycle lasts 8 hours, but posts submitted mid Cycle for example, will only remain under review for the rest of the Cycle. In that case 4 hours. If the community chooses to "Promote" your post it will graduate to the Persona's main page, and your 5 staked REP will be returned. You will also earn 5 REP.

If the community chooses to "Demote" your post it will evaporate, and you will lose your 5 staked REP.

## About Personas
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZYs9nJo.png)

Any player with sufficient GO may create a Persona by selecting the "Create Persona" button on the right side of the screen, above the Persona list.

### Why create a Persona?
One way of looking at a Persona is it's a community of people interested in the same context or topic. For example, a travel-based Persona may attract a group of people curating interesting photos and stories from places around the globe. 

Launching a Persona is for someone who wants to create the context a community of people might gather around. It's for someone who wishes to inspire a community to curate content in a context they're interested in. 

### Create a Persona
![](https://i.imgur.com/Fl5yerY.png)

Once "Create Persona" is selected you will be asked to provide the name of your Persona, a "Persona pitch" (short description), and a full description. 

**Once complete, choose "Proceed".**

![](https://i.imgur.com/IkHE2YW.png)

Now choose the minimum total amount of REP you require Players to have to post in your Persona. Raising the minimum increasingly limits participants to more experienced Players. A Player may not choose a higher REP minimum than their personal total REP amount.

**Keep in mind that no matter what reputation level you choose, the staking requirement to post remains 5 REP.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/84nYAoS.png)

You'll arrive on a Persona preview page where you may add a cover (required) and background images, as well as edit the descriptor text you entered on the preceding page.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZLrGeVx.jpg)

**Complete the requirements and choose "Save changes".**

![](https://i.imgur.com/L08nUUN.png)

Your Persona is then saved as a draft. Before you are able to make it public, you will need to create 5 "seed" posts. Seed posts set the "tone" of the content you hope will be curated through the Persona. Once launched, you cannot control how the community will develop a Persona's content, so seed posts are a great way to influence curation at launch.

**Choose "Proceed" to navigate to your Persona page.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/LjBbnaz.png)

**Choose "Write seed post" and add 5 posts to the Persona page.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/KYIRVvD.png)

**Once you've completed all 5 posts, you are ready to launch your Persona. Select "Publish Persona" in the top right corner.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/nLXQIeI.png)

Publishing a Persona costs 10 GO. If you don't have enough, just wait to publish until the beginning of the next cycle, when you'll be replenished with 30 GO.

**Choose "Proceed".**

## Chat
In Kurate it is possible to chat with a Player whose post was Promoted to a Persona's main page. That way two anonymous Players may communicate with each other around a topic (the post) they're both interested in.

![](https://i.imgur.com/eqr1nnb.png)

**To start a chat with the Poster, use the chat box at the bottom of the post screen. Then tap the arrow to submit.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/fhFq3r1.png)

**From the Original Poster's perspective, they will be able to reply at the bottom of their screen.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/baDDK5h.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/22Jbgsw.png)

**Both Players may hide the original post if they wish to focus on the chat itself.**

The menu in the top right of the screen provides some extra functionality. A Player can close and delete a chat. A Player may also block interactions with another Player if they don't like what that Player has to say.

![](https://i.imgur.com/2omtxlS.png)

**A Player invited to chat may Close the chat or Delete it and Block the Sender instead of responding.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/MkBnvkF.png)

**From the perspective of the blocked Player.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/h6q6aNY.png)

**To reopen a closed chat, use the same menu.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Lo9Y0Rv.png)

When navigated to kurate.eth, logged in Players see both the Persona, and Chats tabs at the top of the screen. Choose "Chats" to see every chat you are participating in. The image thumbnails are randomly generated so you have some way of differentiating them.

## Player Information Screen

Logged in Players may access their information screen by selecting their wallet in the top right corner of the app.
