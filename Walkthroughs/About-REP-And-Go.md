## Overview
EVM compatible apps use tokenomics to promote positive actions and actors in a system, as envisioned by the system's architects. And the simplified version of how it works is, positive actions are rewarded with value, and negative actions are penalized with value-loss or simply ignored. 

Value may be represented in different ways — often it's a spendable token. But sometimes value is access to gated actions and communities, or even a non-spendable badge signifying participation or completion.

In Kurate, gameplay includes a form of tokenomics used to promote action and positive actors, and reduce spam.

## Mechanisms at play
Here is a visual representation of the mechanisms at play, with explanations below.

### The Cycle
In Kurate gameplay is broken up into 8 hour times slots called "Cycles". The beginning and end of a Cycle hold significance, and overall the Cycle encourages Players to "act". 

**Regarding Cycles**:

- Curation of a post (voting) lasts up to 1 Cycle. For posts submitted Mid-Cycle, curation lasts the remainder of that Cycle.
- Promoted posts graduate to the main Persona page at the end of each Cycle. Demoted posts are deleted.
- GO is replenished/burned at the beginning/end of each Cycle.
- REP is allocated and re-calculated at the beginning of each Cycle.

### GO
All Players are given 30 GO at the beginning of each Cycle. GO animates all actions in Kurate — it's the cost of doing business. Every gameplay action a Player takes depletes their GO holdings. GO both limits spam in the ecosystem and promotes activity (capped amount of GO per Player per Cycle + use-it-or-lose-it).

**Go cost per action**:

- Vote on a submitted post: 1 GO
- Submit a post: 5 GO
- Publish a Persona: 10 GO

Players who do not have enough GO will not be able to take the above actions.

GO does not roll over, so any GO left over gets burned at the end of a Cycle. Concurrently, Players start fresh with 30 new GO as the new Cycle begins.

### REP
In Kurate REP is a score that enumerates the "reputation" a Player has accumulated during gameplay. REP is earned through positive interactions (as defined by Kurate devs). REP is not public — your REP score is only visible to you, nor is it spendable. However the more REP a Player accumulates, the more they are able to do in Kurate.

REP also acts as spam prevention, and promotes positive action. REP must be staked when submitting a post, so the total REP one has limits the amount of posts one can submit at a time. Also, a Player loses their staked REP or earns REP based on how relevant the community believes their submitted posts are.

**The mechanics of REP**

- Players must stake 5 REP when submitting a post to community curation (voting).
- A Player loses their stake REP if, by the end of the Cycle, the community votes to Demote their post.
- A Player receives their staked REP back and earns a 5 REP bonus if, by the end of the Cycle, the community votes to Promote their post.
- In case of a tie vote (or if the minimum vote threshold of 3 votes is not met), the Player receives their staked REP back, and the post is deleted.
- Voting Players earn 1 REP if they vote in the direction of the community (whether to Promote or Demote).
- The creator of a Persona sets the minimum total REP a Player must have to submit a post in that Persona. The higher the minimum REP, the better a Player must be to participate. Keep in mind, regardless of the minimum REP requirement, the staking requirement to submit a post is always 5 REP.
- Staked REP is always included in a Player's total REP score for the purpose of determining whether or not they meet minimum REP requirements.
