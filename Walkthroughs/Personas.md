## Overview
In Kurate, a Persona is a group identity that allows anonymous community members to create and curate public content together. From an individual Player's perspective wishing to create content, it's like posting publicly while wearing the Persona as a mask. 

But the community has the opportunity to vote on whether or not a post is "in character" of the Persona. If they vote yes, the post graduates to the Persona's main page. If no, the post gets deleted. Thus communities can anonymously curate context-specific content together.

Also, Players earn reputation (REP) by participating. For example, a Player ears REP by voting in-line with the community on whether or not a post is "in character". And a Player earns REP when the community votes that their post is "in-character".

## How it works
For a complete walkthrough of the app, please [visit this article](https://github.com/logos-innovation-lab/Kurate-expression/blob/Main/Walkthroughs/Full-App-Walkthrough.md).

When a Player submits a content post, it does not immediately go live on the Persona's main page. Instead it gets submitted for community review. 

**The review period is as much as one "Cycle".**
A Cycle is a fixed 8 hours long. Posts submitted for review mid-Cycle will only be eligible for review for the remainder of the current Cycle.

During the review period, a community member may choose to "Promote" or "Demote" the post. If a majority votes to Promote, the post graduates to the main Persona page. If Demoted, the post gets deleted.

In order to encourage action and deter spam, it cost 1 GO token to vote.

## Go tokens
At the beginning of every Cycle (8 hours) players receive 30 GO tokens. In Kurate, GO is required to initiate gameplay actions, which are voting, posting, and creating a Persona. GO does not role over, so at the end of each Cycle unused GO is burned.

**GO cost of gameplay actions:**
- Voting: 1 GO per vote
- Submit a post for review: 5 GO
- Create a Persona: 10 GO

## Reputation (REP)
Players earn reputation (REP) through positive interactions on the platform (as determined by the community), and is used to limit certain actions unless Players have a minimum REP score.

**Earning REP**
Player earn 5 REP when a post they submitted gets Promoted to a Persona's main page. A Player ears 1 REP when they vote on a post in the direction of the community (whether the post is ultimately Promoted or Demoted).

**Staking REP**
REP is used as a way to create a threshold for participation. For example, a Player must stake 5 REP when they submit a post. If their post gets demoted, they lose their REP. If Promoted, their staked REP is returned and they receive 5 bonus REP. 

Because of the 5 REP posting requirement, Players must earn REP through voting (curation) before they are able to post. That way they are able to get a feel for the character of the Persona, and the community posting through it, before posting themselves.

**Minimum REP**

A Player who creates a Persona may chooses a minimum total REP requirement for posting in their Persona. The lower the minimum, the more Players will be able to post. A Player may not choose a higher REP minimum than their personal total REP amount.

Raising the minimum increasingly limits participants to more experienced Players. 

**Keep in mind that no matter what reputation level you choose, the staking requirement to post remains 5 REP.**


## Creating a Persona

### Why create a Persona?
One way of looking at a Persona is it's a community of people interested in the same context or topic. For example, a travel-based Persona may attract a group of people curating interesting photos, stories, and products from places around the globe. 

Launching a Persona is for someone who wants to create the context a community of people might gather around. It's for someone who wishes to inspire a community to curate content in a context they're interested in. 

### Step-by-step

Any player with sufficient GO may create a Persona by selecting the "Create Persona" button on the right side of the screen, above the Persona list.

Once "Create Persona" is selected you will be asked to provide the name of your Persona, a "Persona pitch" (short description), and a full description. 

**Once complete, choose "Proceed".**

Now choose the minimum total amount of REP you require Players to have to post in your Persona. Raising the minimum increasingly limits participants to more experienced Players. A Player may not choose a higher REP minimum than their personal total REP amount.

**Keep in mind that no matter what reputation level you choose, the staking requirement to post remains 5 REP.**

You'll arrive on a Persona preview page where you may add a cover (required) and background images, as well as edit the descriptor text you entered on the preceding page.

**Complete the requirements and choose "Save changes".**

Your Persona is then saved as a draft. Before you are able to make it public, you will need to create 5 "seed" posts. Seed posts set the "tone" of the content you hope will be curated through the Persona. Once launched, you cannot control how the community will develop a Persona's content, so seed posts are a great way to influence curation at launch.

**Choose "Proceed" to navigate to your Persona page.**

**Choose "Write seed post" and add 5 posts to the Persona page.**

**Once you've completed all 5 posts, you are ready to launch your Persona. Select "Publish Persona" in the top right corner.**

Publishing a Persona costs 10 GO. If you don't have enough, just wait to publish until the beginning of the next cycle, when you'll be replenished with 30 GO.

**Choose "Proceed".**
