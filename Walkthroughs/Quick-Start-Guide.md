## Overview
Gameplay in Kurate is easy and fun! You have two main objectives. The first is to anonymously post content through a group identity called a "Persona". A Persona is the public face of any content you post in Kurate. Players post content that's "in the character of" a Persona.

The second is to help curate Persona content by voting on whether or not you believe posts from your peers are "in the character of" that Persona. You earn reputation through both objectives.

Players may also create a Persona for community members to curate content through.

## Quick Start
### Step 1: Connect your web3 wallet.
Navigate to kurate.eth, and choose "Connect wallet" in the top right hand corner of the screen.

### Step 2: Choose a Persona
On the home screen you see a list of active Personas with short descriptions of each. Choose one you find interesting by selecting it.

### Step 3: Curate Persona Content

On the Persona page, you may submit a post, or review pending posts. To help curate content for this Persona, choose "Review pending".

You will then see all the posts submitted by other Players within the current Cycle. **A Cycle in Kurate lasts 8 hours, and posts submitted within the current Cycle have the remainder of the Cycle to receive votes.**

You may choose to "Promote" or "Demote" a post. To "Promote" means to believe the post is appropriate for the Persona. To "Demote" means you do not believe the posts is appropriate.

Voting costs 1 GO (you have 30 GO to spend each Cycle), and you earn 1 REP if you vote in-line with the majority of voters.

### Step 4: Post content through a Persona

By choosing "Submit post" on the main Persona page you will land on an info page. It informs you that submitting a post requires 5 GO and 5 staked REP. You must first earn enough REP to post, by participating in the curation process (Step 3). Each Cycle you receive 30 GO to spend on voting and posting.

**Please note. Different Personas may have different minimum total REP requirements to participate in posting.**

For example, a Persona that has a 100 REP minimum requires the Player to have at least 100 total REP to submit a post. However, this minimum does not change the 5 REP staking requirement. So in this example a Player must have at least 100 total REP, and 5 available (not staked) REP.

**Choose Proceed.**

Write your post copy, and add an image by selecting the "picture" icon next to the "Submit" button. 

**When finished, select "Submit".**

Your post is now Pending curation from the community, who has the remainder of the current Cycle to vote to Promote or Demote. If Promoted, your post will graduate to the main page. Your 5 staked REP will return AND you will receive a 5 REP reward. Nice!

If Demoted, your post will be deleted and you will lose your 5 staked REP :( Sad, but those are the breaks!

For more information about Posting, please see this article.

### Step 5: Chat

A Player may chat with another Player whose post was Promoted to a Persona's main page. 

**Navigate to the post, and start a chat at the bottom of the screen.**

The Original Poster may reply to the post, or use the menu in the top right corner of the screen to delete the post and block the sender.

Logged in Players who navigate to Kurate.ETH see both the Personas tab and the Chats tab towards the top of their screen. 

**Choose "Chats" to see all the chats you are involved in.**

## Advanced Gameplay
### Step 6: Create a Persona
One way to describe a Persona is that it provides context for content curation. Players ask themselves: "What type of content is characteristic of this Persona?" , and "Is 'this' content appropriate for this Persona?"

You might be interested in launching a Persona if you'd like to see how a community of anonymous Players would create and curate content  based on context you provide.

**From kurate.eth, choose "Create persona" on the right side above the Persona list.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/jTuirIm.png)

Give your Persona a name, a short description called a "pitch", and a longer more detailed description.

**Then choose Proceed.**

As the Persona creator, you get to choose the minimum REP score needed for someone to submit a post. A higher minimum may result in higher quality content, but less participation.

- A Player cannot set a minimum REP higher than their total REP at time of Persona creation.
- Minimum REP refers to "Total REP" at the time of posting.
- Minimum REP does not change the staking requirement. Posting always cost 5 REP.

**Choose proceed.**

**Add cover and background images, and "Save changes".**

At this point your Persona is pending until you write 5 seed posts. Seed posts allow the Persona creator to "set the tone" for the Persona. Once launched, the character of a Persona is developed by the community, and the creator only has the same influence as everyone else. Seed posts are the best opportunity to set content expectations at launch, though with no guarantee the community will follow them.

**Once 5 seed posts are created, you will be able to Publish your Persona, which costs 10 GO.**
