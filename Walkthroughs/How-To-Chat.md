# How To Chat
###### tags: `Kurate` `expression` `FAQ`

In Kurate it is possible to chat with a Player whose post was Promoted to a Persona's main page. That way two anonymous Players may communicate with each other around a topic (the post) they're both interested in.

When navigated to kurate.eth, logged in Players see both the Persona, and Chats tabs at the top of the screen. 

**Choose "Chats" to see every chat you are participating in.**

The image thumbnails are randomly generated so you have some way of differentiating them.

**To start a chat with the Poster, use the chat box at the bottom of the post screen. Then tap the arrow to submit.**

**Both Players may hide the original post if they wish to focus on the chat itself.**

The menu in the top right of the screen provides some extra functionality. A Player can close and delete a chat. A Player may also block interactions with another Player if they don't like what that Player has to say.
