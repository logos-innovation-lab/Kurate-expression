### Description
"You" is a watcher not bound by space or time. Where You goes and what You sees is up to you. Each post is a complete thought, not a continuation of a prior post. We are choosing an adventure together.

Up all night, and now a glow starts to creep around, creep over the ageless and angle-less line of delineation between earth and sky. You think: normally it's shadows that creep around, and creep over. They make their way around buildings and under foot. They flow and tuck into the periphery. They chase and follow, nipping at your heals, until the sun passes its zenith. Then after midday what do the shadows do? They conspire to take over, and this appears to give them confidence. They gain power throughout the afternoon. As the day slips, results become more rapid; the light relenting to shadow's relentless push, and then gone. That's where you sit. Perched on a half wall watching it all. The neuros keeping you alert throughout the night, which in comparison to the day, feels like stasis. Unmoving. A dismount. Like an exhale held still, heart in throat, eyes affixed. You breath and the new day begins.

Incoming light coaxes your body into astir, and you realize you've been sitting statue still. For how long? Hours probably. You cannot remember when last you moved, and since night has no lines of demarcation to measure by, you have no reference to draw from to make an educated guess. Only body signals. As you scan them for data the glow sharpens, as shards of the sun begin to dissect the biosphere. you look up at the moons.

The flight to Ozzima barely registered in either hemisphere of your brain. Both were for the most part unconscious. The right played a dream on loop. You were on a craft, an environmental so no suit was required. You forgot which floor was the mess, but were eager to find it. You walked down a hallway with no doors, and at the end of it was a bulkhead â€” the kind you remember from northern Earth. Normally an entrance to a sub-structure. Unlocked, you pulled the left door open with your left hand, which unveiled a stone staircase, stepping down. You follow it, and on the ground floor you found yourself in hallway with no doors...When you woke you wondered how many times you looped around. Surely thousands of reps would fit inside a 29 day flight.

-SIRENS BLARE, LIGHTS STROBE- Startled you look down at the O2 meter on your right wrist. Shit! Less than 5 minutes left. Better get the axe.

One more step up makes the surface. For decades ships have employed a burrow mod between the bottom thrusters. Upon landing, once the gear takes over and the ship is stable, the thrusters retract into the base. Then a clockwise lasersaw carves a channel into the ground below. Once deep enough the gear (on shocks for passenger comfort) rolls itself into the channel, setting the door about three meters below grade. This mod was developed after several commercial flights landed on unmapped territory, and pitched over due to tectonic movement. But the real savings is energy. A buried base helps stabilize thermal fluctuations inside the habitat, resulting in less energy consumption needed to moderate climate. But it does lengthen the climb you have to make to get to the surface.
