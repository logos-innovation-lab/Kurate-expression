# Persona Treatment: Sam Who Needs Redemption
## Preamble
The Outlet is a place where individuals can experience anonymous interaction and gain anonymous reputation, through game play as a group identity. In other words, "anonymity with accountability through group identity". 

We call these group identities Personas, and individual players can don a Persona like a mask and use it as their forward-facing self. It's possible for many anonymous players to play as the same Persona at the same time.

Personas can have different "looks". For example, a Persona can look like a brand curating content, or an individual with goals. Different looks provide a different game play experience for anonymous players, even if the game play mechanism is standardized. 

**We're building these Personas in-app, so that anyone can try them out.**

We are at the very beginning of working with anonymous identity and group reputation, so we think this approach will best illustrate what's possible to all who use it.

These different looks are thought experiments. We hope they will inspire other teams and orgs to create their own spin on it. **The future is private but accountable. The future is fun!**

For more information about anonymity with accountability through group identity, please [read this post](https://github.com/logos-innovation-lab/theoutlet-expression/blob/Main/Personas/Gamifying-The-Outlet-The-Personas.md).

## Backstory For The Sam Persona
### Sam is coming off the worst year of his life. 
Sam is not a good person and now his reputation is in the shitter. Sam has a large following and an over-sized influence over millions of lives. And while he could have used his position to enrich his following and help create a positive community, Sam did the exact opposite. 

He used his influence to defraud, steal, lie, manipulate financial markets, and generally cause mayhem to a level rarely seen. By doing so, Sam hurt scores of innocent people who trusted him.

Sam gambled away his future. He gambled away his followers' futures. And he lost big.

### We're not gonna take it.
As mentioned, Sam has a huge following. But now that Sam has torched his reputation, all the potential good his influence could do is in danger of going to waste. We don't have to let that happen!


In The Outlet, the community can "play" as the Sam Persona. We can help rehabilitate Sam's reputation by being a force for good. We can use his influence to make a positive impact, redeeming Sam's identity in the process.

## Game Play Overview
Sam's all out of money, but he does have ample time on his hands now that he's no longer living a swinging CEO lifestyle. So Sam is going to use his time to write encouraging messages to the community. He hopes to use his platform to bring a little joy into the world. To be a good influence and win back his reputation.

As his reputation grows, Sam could curate goods and services that will create positive experiences for those who follow him. 

## Your Job: Help Redeem Sam So He Can Repay His Victims
- "Play as Sam" by posting positive and helpful messages in the community: The more positive Posts come from Sam, the better Sam's reputation will get.
- Help curate positive vibez by voting on whether a Post is appropriate for Sam's new rehabilitated reputation.

## Game Mechanics
**As a Player, post good!**
- Once a Player posts, the community will have x hours to decide the Post's fate. If deemed good? The post will hit Sam's Timeline and you will earn reputation as a good poster. If not, the Post gets retired and you will lose the reputation you staked on your post.

**As a Player, vote good!**
- Once a Post has been submitted the community has x hours to decide if it's appropriate for the community or not. 
- Players get 30 "Votes" per Epoch (x hours) and can use 1 or all 30 on a single Post.
- Votes don't carry over to the next Epoch, so use them or lose them!
- If you vote in the direction the community decides, you gain reputation as a good curator.

**As a Player, vend good! (If possible and within scope)**
- You may post items or services for sale. Just like all other content Posts, the community will have x hours to decide if your item is appropriate for the community. 
- If deemed good, your Post will hit Sam's Timeline, and community members will be able to purchase. You'll also receive reputation as a good poster.

**Odds and Ends we could do (if possible and within scope)**
- At the end of an epoch, if good posts outnumber bad posts, the Sam persona could automatically Post: "Today I've been a positive member of the community. Yay! We did it fam!"
- The Sam Persona wants to send his messages far and wide so he can get more people to help keep him on track. So he's hooked up to Twitter, and all his positive posts are also sent out as tweets.
