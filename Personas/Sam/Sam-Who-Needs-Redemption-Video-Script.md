# Sam Who Needs Redemption Video Script
#### A video in the style of a video game trailer.

## Music
Pulsing bass plus piano on one note about 100 bpm. When the game play is revealed, it gets up beat an orchestrated. 8 Bit and modern blend.

## Cinematography

## Script
**Narrator**: This is Sam, he runs a company.

**Sam**: Guys! You know one think I hate about running this business?
**Chorus**: What is it? No tell us.

**Sam**: Our customers' money is so dirty. Hey I've got an idea!

**Chorus**: What is it? No tell us.
**Sam**: Let's build a laundromat so we can wash their dirty money and make it clean.
**Chorus**: Yay!

**Narrator**: So they bought a laundromat and things started OK.

**Sam**: Check it out! Shovel the money in, and hit wash, and that's it!

**Chorus**: It's so easy!

**Narrator**: But then things went very wrong.

**Chorus member**: (opens a machine) Hey Sam where'd all the money go?!

**Sam**: Oh no! I forgot to put drain covers on! They money must be in the sewers by now!

**Chorus**: A din of "Forgot? No. How dumb do you think we are?"
(show bankers, MIC, politicians filling up money bags under the laundromat)

**Bankers, MIC, Politicians**: Hehehehe

### In the courtroom
**Judge** (maybe judge Judy or Wapner): Sam you've been found guilty of washing customer funds down the drain. You're gonna have to pay them all back.

**Sam**: Damn judge that's a lot of money! But I'll give it the old Stanford try.

### Outside the courtroom
**Friend**: What are you gonna do?

**Sam**: I don't know I don't have any money. How can I make amends?

**Friend**: I got it! You should become an influencer... but a good one this time!

**Sam**: Great idea!
