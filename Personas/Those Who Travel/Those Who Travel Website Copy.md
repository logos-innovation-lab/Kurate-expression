### How to play with us

[Create post image]: **Every picture tells a story.**
Create a compelling, thoughtful post and tap "submit". Make it a good one because you're staking a bit of your reputation on it.

Your post goes through a curation process where the community votes on whether or not to promote it. When a post of yours is promoted, it means it fits the character of the community, and you earn reputation points as a reward. Right on!

On the other hand, if your post gets demoted, you lose your staked reputation. It might be kind of a let down, but that's how we curate the very best scenes and anecdotes from around the world.

[Vote image]: **Is that a discerning eye I see?**
The quality of the content is completely up to you. Help promote the best images and stories. Delightful or dismal, moving or macabre, the human experience happens on here on Earth. Let's see it all!

Promote or demote. Either way you earn reputation as an excellent judge of the character of our community if the voting majority agrees with you.
