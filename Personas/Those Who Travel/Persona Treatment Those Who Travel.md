# Persona Treatment: Those Who Travel

## Preamble
Kurate is a place where individuals can experience anonymous interaction and gain anonymous reputation, through game play as a group identity. In other words, "anonymity with accountability through group identity". 

We call these group identities Personas, and individual players can don a Persona like a mask and use it as their forward-facing self. It's possible for many anonymous players to play as the same Persona at the same time.

Personas can have different "looks". For example, a Persona can look like a brand curating content, or an individual with goals. Different looks provide a different game play experience for anonymous players, even if the game play mechanism is standardized. 

**We're building these Personas in-app, so that anyone can try them out.**

We are at the very beginning of working with anonymous identity and group reputation, so we think this approach will best illustrate what's possible to all who use it.

These different looks are thought experiments. We hope they will inspire other teams and orgs to create their own spin on it. **The future is private but accountable. The future is fun!**

## Treatment
The Those Who Travel community curates the best images and stories from travelers all around the world. Whether youâ€™re a digital nomad, a weekender, an adventurer, or salesperson on the move, we want to see unique vistas and original perspectives. Our world through your eyes, the full range of it.

### Game Play Overview: Posting
Create a compelling, thoughtful post and tap "submit". You'll be staking a bit of your reputation on each post.

Your post then goes through a curation process where the community votes on whether or not to promote it. When a post of yours is promoted, it means it fits the character of the community, and you earn reputation points as a reward.

If your post gets demoted instead, you lose your staked reputation. 

### Game Play Overview: Voting
You get to vote on posts too! Every day you'll get 30 votes to use. They don't carry over, so make sure to use them up each day!

And every time you vote, if you vote in the direction of the community (either to promote or demote) you'll earn reputation as a good curator.
