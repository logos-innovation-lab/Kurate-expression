#  Playing With Personas

## Overview
Kurate can be described as a privacy-enabled group curation application with built-in reputation. We are building it with zero-knowledge privacy and reputation technologies, and we hope to do so in a unique way so it inspires the Logos community to refine and develop it for public adoption.

## Playing Kurate
Game play centers around which "Persona" one adopts when they wish to interact in Kurate. A Persona represents a group identity. All Players who log in get an anonymous identity, and they get to choose which Persona they want to "play" as.

Sometimes a Persona takes on the attributes of a brand, for example a travel blog. Players might post pictures and stories from interesting locations. The avatar of this type of avatar might be a logo

Sometimes a Persona takes on the attributes of an individual who has motivations, or tasks to complete. The avatar of this type of Persona could be the image of a person.

Sometimes a Persona takes on the attributes of an art project, where Players create it together.

Users may interact by posting as an anonymous individual  "through" these Personas.

### How it could look
On the "choose identity" screen, a wallet-connected Player may choose a Persona to interact as, from a collection of tiles. Players interact anonymously in the app as themselves — an Anonymous "chorus-member", akin to the chorus in a musical play. 

They all appear the same, but can earn reputation by playing as Personas. Reputation is earned by posting content the Persona's community deems appropriate. Or, by helping to curate good content through voting on whether or not a post is appropriate for the community 


**Below are several examples of what those Personas might look like.**

### Examples of Persona types that could exist. An "association", an "individual", and an "art project".

**Brand: The Brand of Your Life**

TBOYL posts products, design ideas, books, art, and entertainment that makes you say "Oh shit, that's fucking awesome!" Join TBOYL and help curate the best stuff on Earth, and earn good reputation while doing it.

**Individual: Sam Who Needs Redemption**

Sam is not a good person — his reputation is in the shitter. He committed a fraud that hurt a lot of innocent people, using his influence in a destructive way. 

Well, as a community we're not going to stand for it. So we're taking control of Sam's identity in order to rehabilitate his reputation. Players who adopt the Sam Persona are tasked with giving the Sam identity a second chance by posting helping content. Will he become a positive influence, thus helping to right past wrongs? If so, Sam may indeed find redemption

**Art Project: A Book Eternal**
A Book Eternal is a group curated novel where Players propose lines, paragraphs, or chapters to continue the story.


## Persona Profile Screen
A Persona's profile screen gives details about the Persona. It might be that for technical reasons we need to keep the in-app profile screen spartan. In that case, we could link out to a web2 landing page with more details. Depending on the persona type, examples of these details could be:
- Motivations or goals
- Manifesto
- Backstory video
- Illustrations
- Admittance to membership criteria, or posting suggestions if applicable

## Fun Questions to ponder that affect game play
- What does it mean to "play" as a service-provider persona like a rideshare association, vs. an individual-persona that has motivations/goals?
- What if we build thresholds (monthly posting goals as an example) and what does that look like? The idea being, falling below a certain "promote" threshold gets the Persona bricked, or has to start from scratch.
- What if user reputation determine what types of things can be done as the Persona, for example, the more reputable you are, the more ways you can interact as the Persona?
- What if commerce is added into posts, such that the Persona becomes context for a marketplace?
- What, in the case commerce can be added, a posting "fee" could go to Persona wallet. Combined with thresholds, this could be the backbone of a nonprofit, or restitution tool. Then a community could "raise funds" in the name of an perpetrator — to pay back people harmed in exchange malfeasance for example. Posting could direct funds captured in the Persona wallet.
- What if a Persona could broadcast promoted content to other social media platforms? Then a group could curate online identities throughout the web.
