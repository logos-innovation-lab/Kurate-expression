A Game Called The Outlet: Vibe And Treatment

---

## Slide 1: You're playing a game called The Outlet

## Slide 2: The scene is an underground station in a hyper-modern city

Onscreen a bullet train arrives at an underground station in a city that looks like downtown Tokyo. It's night time. The light is soft and most details are illuminated by neon lights accenting the area. The train doors open and you see your avatar step down onto the platform. It is then you realize you have control.

---

## Slide 3: You are not alone

You are not alone. Dozens of other players' avatars wander about, some exiting other train cars, some making their way to a large door with a bright neon sign hanging above it. It blinks "Enter".

---

## Slide 4: You take control and start to move around

You notice all avatars look the same, but you can differentiate which one is "you" by the floating arrow above your head. And the camera puts you in the center of the screen.

You use the controller to move. Your avatar walks with conviction in the direction you point it.

---

## Slide 5: "Enter" is the call you were meant to hear

As you move around you realize that although the station is visually appealing, there's not much to do here. The other avatars milling about might as well be shadows. You can't interact with them. 

They don't speak to you, and even if they could you don't know how to reply. No! The obvious takeaway from the scene? "Enter" is the call you were meant to hear. So you walk towards the door.

---

## Slide 6: You are eager to explore

Using the arrow keys for forward, backwards, left and right, you make your way. As you get closer you see to the left of the doorway it a line of desks. 

A terminal sits upon each desk, and several of them are being used by other avatars. It's not clear what they're doing, but does appear to be your near term destination, since there is no way to approach the entrance and the door without encountering the bank of Terminals.

---

## Slide 7: You approach a Terminal and await instructions

Your avatar approaches one of the Terminals and stands there looking at it. Now your view shifts to first person, and it appears you are looking through your Avatar's eyes. The Terminal takes up the bulk of your field of vision.

---

## Slide 8: Welcome to The Outlet

"Welcome to The Outlet" it reads. "The Outlet is where you go to privately trade with reputable actors. "Before you is the entrance, and once inside you'll be able to find goods and services, and people to provide them. 

You'll be able to communicate with them, and transact, and everyone interested in voluntary, peaceful interactions is welcome. But before you enter you need to establish a little bit of reputation. 

---

## Slide 9: Type "y" / hit "enter"

"But don't worry!" it goes on to say.  "We know you're new, so the requirements are quite simple. That said if you decide you're not ready, simply turn back the way you came and get on the train. But if you're game, type y and then hit "enter" in the Terminal. And we'll proceed".

So you do as suggested. Y. Enter.

---

## Slide 10: There are two requirements for entry

"Excellent!" it reads. "There are two requirements for entry. And once you complete them you are free to enter The Outlet. Now, when you get inside you will be limited to where you can go, since different shops and rooms require different types and amounts of reputation. 

But you'll have ample opportunity to earn that reputation as you go. First things first, here are the two requirements. 

---

## Slide 11: Watch this video
![](https://i.imgur.com/J6xTiGY.jpg)

The text continues: "The first requirement is to watch this overview video. If you're ready for it to play, type "y" "enter".

So you do as instructed and the video begins to play **[video plays]**. It describes The Outlet and its rules, as well as how you use your keycard to gain entry, pay for goods and services, and prove your reputation.

---

## Slide 12: Get your keycard

Once the video stops the text continues. "The second requirement is for you to receive your keycard and fund it with a bit of cash." There's a little slot next to the Terminal screen, and out pops what looks like a credit card. 

It has the symbol of The Outlet on one side, the other side is blank. You take it in your hand, and as instructed in the video use it along with The Outlet app to create your identity and wallet.

---

## Slide 13: Fund your wallet

More text: "Once you fund your wallet with 10 credits you will be allowed to enter The Outlet. At the door, you'll be asked to put 5 of your credits into escrow with the community in case a conflict arises. 

You'll just tap your card to consent to that transaction. Upon leaving, whatever remains of your escrow will be returned to you." 

And lastly: "Thank you so much for contributing to The Outlet community. Please proceed to the door as soon as you're ready."

---

## Slide 14: Beyond the door
![](https://i.imgur.com/ftTeXMq.jpg)

Your field of view shifts back to where it once was, and you see your avatar in the center of the screen. You take control and move to the entrance. To the right of the door is another Terminal, but this one asks you if you're willing to send funds into escrow, which you will do using the app. You decide to consent to the escrow, tapping your keycard, and the door opens. You walk through.

# Slide 15: The Outlet lounge

You stand in a room and you are not alone. Some avatars walk about. Some are seated together. Perhaps they are enjoying each others' company, but in silence. You notice a chat box now appears on your screen in the bottom right of your view. There's a caption that says: "Lounge". 

Below it  You see chat text â€” presumably it's the people in this lounge chatting with each other. You have the ability to chat a well, since everyone who has established the reputation to enter The Outlet may chat in this lounge. 

At the far side you see a bank of windows, and beyond it is lights and activity. For now, that doesn't concern you. You're excited to take this opportunity to get to know the community by chatting with your peers. 

**The rest will come in time.**
