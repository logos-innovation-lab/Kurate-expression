## The light in me recognizes and honors the light in you.
Raydee is the home city of peaceful people known as the Raydians. With the help of a prism-like device called a "Kee" they hold in their hand, their internal energy can be focused, refracted, and projected as radiant light. Each Raydian is unique, therefore the color and brilliance of their internal energy is also unique. Without the Kee, they have an "all or nothing" choice for emanating their internal light. To reveal all is to be completely exposed.

Some Raydians are more creative, some more practical and the light reveals that. Some are older, and perhaps wiser and more amber. Some are younger, with white-hot brilliance. Some are philosophers and carpenters. There are blue flames, green, and orange depending on the makeup of their inner light. The full spectrum is possible. .


### Their light is their identity, their fingerprint. 
It represents all their characteristics — creativity, knowledge, skillset, everything they've earned, experienced, and learned expressed as their individual hue. But it also shows their "state". You can see when they're all filled up, supercharged. You can see when their energy is low, in need of a meal of nourishing electrons. Their age and fitness. How they feel at the moment. All of it.

Since their light shows everything about these Raydee City dwellers, it's the most precious thing in the world to them. You might imagine they are protective of exposing their light, and you would be right! Raydians are inherently peaceful people, but like all societies there is a small percentage of anti-social beings among them looking to take advantage, hurt, or steal. So it's important Raydians can guard themselves and their light against folly. 

But also, sometimes it's just more comfortable to keep certain personal things to oneself, for all parties involved. 


### Raydians choose what they emit.
Luckily, using the Kee, Raydians have the ability to choose which frequencies of their light get emitted, and how much. And they may emit all, nothing, or anything in between. But! They cannot emit what's not there, only what they've created, earned, or learned. The Kee focuses their light to the exact hue needed at the time, but is true to what exists internally.

**It takes a certain amount of wisdom to discern when and what to show, so Raydians wait until they are mature enough to earn their Kee.**

If they want to move through the world completely protected they would keep their key secure, and only their pilot light — their spark of life would show. But in many cases (for example instances where they might need to show reputation) they would find it fitting to emit light, in hue and brilliance, that represents the attributes of them they wish others to see — what is appropriate for the context of the moment.

### Trade in Raydee.
Like all peaceful people, Raydians trade with each other for goods and services. Their preferred marketplace is **The Outlet**, where they go to find all sorts of supplies, or just to simply recharge. They happily give a little bit of their light energy as payment for the things they need. 

The transaction is quite something to see! When it's time to pay, both Raydians hold up their Kees facing each other, and energy is transferred from one to the other, focused through their Kee, absorbed by their inner light.

Although an open market, **The Outlet** isn't some free-for-all. No-no-no! There are reputational requirements for entry, so Raydians must emit enough of themselves to satisfy that requirement. But beyond that minimum they only reveal what they choose.

## Milestone 0: Create Identities

Rena has come of age and earned her Kee. Kees allow residents of Raydee City the ability to show certain, appropriate-for-the-situation aspects of their identity and reputation. It helps them prove trustworthy in commerce settings, friendly in social settings. 

Rena is excited to take it for a spin, knowing she can now access parts of the city that were once closed off to her because she could not prove her reputation. She's most interested in social places where she can connect with other Raydians with similar values.

But first things first! Rena must learn how to program her Kee to only emit the aspects of her identity needed for specific contexts she finds herself in. For example when renting an Otto, it's important for Rena to be able to prove she has passed safety tests, and that she has insurance. But it's not necessary to show her exact date of birth. So she must program her Kee to emit some things, and filter out the rest. 

Let's help Rena integrate and use this valuable technology so she can explore parts of her city once closed off to her. Help her find people and interact.

### Epics

**One**: As a sentient being I create identities using ZK proofs and a Logos Keycard, so that I may interact with other sentient beings using the same technology.

**Two**: As a sentient being I can switch between identities I created with ZK proofs and a Logos Keycard.

**Three**: As a sentient being I can choose which aspects of my identity I would like to show while interacting with others.

**Four**: As a sentient being, using an identity I created with ZK proofs and a Logos keycard, I can enter a virtual place and chat with others using the same technology.


## Notes

### General
- Raydians and Raydee as a concept for the artistic version of "The Outlet" content: website, videos, illustrations
- Raydians are the characters depicted in The Outlet's high level concept. It's their interactions that will be used to describe functionality throughout The Outlet's dev milestones.
- Used as a artistic compliment to more 'practical' content like app walkthrough videos and blog posts.


### Website
Just like each dev Milestone builds on the previous, so is this website. For Milestone 0, when browsing to the URL, picture:
- A large illustration of a Raydian appears, holding their "Kee". An explanation of the image appears below it. This image represents "Epic One: create user with keycard".
- Lo and behold the image is actually a carousel! The  viewer may tap an arrow and the image moves off the screen to the left. Now an illustration and description for "Epic 2: User switching" is shown on the screen.
- The interaction continues in this way to show all Epics for Milestone 0.
- When it's time to depict Milestone 1, it will be added to the Website. One idea is the Milestone 0 section becomes a part of a larger page. "Zoom out" to see the Milestone 0 carousel on the left side, while Milestone 1 is depicted on the right.
