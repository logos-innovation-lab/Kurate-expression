## Summary
Kurate is Logos Innovation Lab (LIL)'s first project. It can be described as a privacy-enabled group curation application with built-in reputation. 

Imagine if we could all be Satoshi Nakamoto's online Persona. What would we say? In Kurate, you and your peers remain anonymous but post publicly as a Persona. It’s like everyone is wearing a Satoshi Mask.

**But it’s not just a free-for-all.**

Your peers vote on whether or not your post is characteristic of what Satoshi would say. If they think it is, your post goes public and you earn positive reputation.

**You vote on your peers posts too.**

That way as a community, you are curating the Satoshi Nakamoto Persona together. Unfolding his character one post at a time, through text and images. And when you vote in-line with the community, you earn positive reputation.

## Technology
We are using ZK-Proof technology to ensure privacy, and either non-repudiable reputation a-la [Unirep](https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/unirep-a-private-and-non-repudiable-reputation-system-7fb5c6478549), or zero-knowledge group membership like [Semaphore](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/) (or a combination of both) to enable participants to privately submit and curate public content.

## Expressing Kurate
LIL approaches each project in a holistic way. We aim to convey an idea, a philosophy — the "why" behind actions and interactions — comprehensively. As code, as copy, as design and UX, as art and illustration, and as narrative. 

Summed together, we hope those who interact with our project will not only enjoy their experience with the app, but also feel how much care we have for it, and intention we put into it. That they may experience its necessity, its reason for existence as we intend it.

**How we may express Kurate:**
- A story or theme
- A decentralized app with inviting UX
- Illustrations and Animations
- Videos - walkthrough, narrative, howto
- Swag

We make technology. Technology is but a tool that can be used for human enrichment or human enslavement. It's the philosophy behind the technology that determines which. 

**Ours is peace. Let us show you :)**

## Kurate: How To Play The Game
Players will experience what it's like to join Kurate anonymously, but "play" as a group identity we call a Persona. 

For example, sometimes a Persona may "look like" a brand.  To play as a brand Persona means to post content, goods, and services one believes is appropriate for that brand. 

A Player would ask themselves: "What types of things would this Persona share and amplify if they were a real person, with a real identity?" And then post accordingly. Another question might be "What types of content reflect the character of this community?"

Players also help curate appropriate content by "voting" on whether or not to amplify others' posts. If the community deems a post appropriate, it will be amplified to the Persona's main public page.

In return Players earn reputation within the context of that Persona. For example, a Player who's posts are deemed appropriate by the community will gain reputation. And a Player who votes on a post in the same direction as the majority of voters will also earn reputation.

In this way Players may retain their privacy while remaining accountable.

**We are building a game experience in order to best express Kurate**. That includes several Personas anyone can play as.

Check out the Personas in the [Github folder here](https://github.com/logos-innovation-lab/Kurate-expression/tree/Main/Personas).

**Examples of the types of things Players can do in Kurate**:
- Create an anonymous identity.
- Post anonymously as a Persona.
- Vote on the appropriateness of a post from another Player.
- Stake reputation on a Post — earning reputation if the community votes to amplify it.
- Earn reputation through curating community-appropriate posts.
- Anonymously Chat
- Create a Persona
