# The Outlet ReadMe
###### tags: `project 1`

## Summary
The Outlet is Logos Lab's first project. It can be described as a privacy-enabled buy/sell marketplace with built-in reputation. We are using ZK-Proof technology to ensure privacy, and either non-repudiable reputation a-la [Unirep](https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/unirep-a-private-and-non-repudiable-reputation-system-7fb5c6478549), or zero-knowledge group membership like [Semaphore](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/) (or a combination of both) to let participants **privately trade goods with reputable actors**. If they so wish.

## Expressing The Outlet
Logos Labs approaches each project in a holistic way. We aim to convey an idea, a philosophy — the "why" behind actions and interactions — comprehensively. As code, as copy, as design and UX, as art and illustration, and as narrative. Summed together, we hope those who interact with our project will not only enjoy their experience with the app, but also feel how much care we have for it, and intention we put into it. That they may experience its necessity, its reason for existence as we intend it.

**How we may express The Outlet:**
- A story or theme
- A decentralized app with inviting UX
- Illustrations and Animations
- Videos - walkthrough, narrative, howto
- Swag


We make technology. Technology is but a tool. It can be used for human enrichment or human enslavement. It's the philosophy behind the technology that determines which. Ours is peace. Let us show you :)

## Milestones
### Milestone 1: Create privacy-enabled identities and chat.

- Epic 1: As a sentient being I create identities using ZK proofs and a Logos Keycard, so that I may interact with other sentient beings using the same technology.
- Epic 2: I can switch between identities I created with ZK proofs and a Logos Keycard.
- Epic 3: I can choose which aspects of my identity I would like to show while interacting with others.
- Epic 4: Using an identity I created with ZK proofs and a Logos keycard, I can enter a virtual place and chat with others using the same technology.

### Milestone 2: Post requets and offers in context.

- Epic 1: As a sentient being I can post a request a request or offer in a marketplace, thus giving my post context.
- Epic 2: I can add helpful details to my post, for example images, pricing, descriptions, etc.

### Milestone 3: Buy or sell something.

### Milestone 4: Sustain the ecosystem.
